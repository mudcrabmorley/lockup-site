              Lock Up Industries are fully QBCC licensed to service and repair
              existing fire doors within your building to ensure they are
              functioning correctly and safely.
            </p>

            <p>
              Fire doors can easily become non-compliant when the doorsâ€™s
              integrity has been modified or damaged. Often this is caused by
              constant wear and tear, alterations or modifications to fire
              doors, such as installation of non-fire rated locks, removal of
              the door closers, installation of dead bolts and hold open
              devices, etc. What may seem to be the smallest of modifications to
              a fire door can have a devastating effect on the protection of
              people and property in the case of a fire.
            </p>

            <p>
              Lock Up Industries are also fully qualified and licensed builders
              and can complete building repairs if required. This means that
              even if you need a wall repaired or rebuilt as part of your fire
              door repairs, we can assist.
            </p>

            <p>
              Lock Up Industries also provides pressed metal door frame repairs
              and replacements with onsite welding services provided to all
              types of frames including stainless steel.
            </p>

            <p>
