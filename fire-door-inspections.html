              The Queensland Development Code (QDC) part MP 6.1 requires
              building occupiers to complete an
              <strong>'Occupiers Statement'</strong> annually and submit the
              statement on completion to the Queensland Fire and Rescue Service,
              confirming that fire safety installations have been maintained.
            </p>

            <p>
              Lock Up Industries can assist you in meeting your maintenance and
              record keeping obligations for prescribed fire safety
              installations in accordance with the QDC. Fire door inspections
              and maintenance are carried out in accordance with
              <strong>AS1851-2012</strong>,
              <strong>Building Fire Safety Regulation 2008</strong> &amp;
              <strong>Queensland Development Code MP6.1</strong>. Routine fire
              door inspections and maintenance will ensure the fire doors in
              your building are functioning correctly and safely.
            </p>

            <p>
              Fire doors can easily become non-compliant when the doorsâ€™
              integrity has been modified. Often this is caused by unlicensed
              people making adjustments or alterations to fire doors, such as
              installation of a non-fire rated lock, removal of the door closer,
              installation of a dead bolt, and hold open devices, etc.
            </p>

            <p>
              It is important that fire door inspections are carried out on a
              regular basis as prescribed for the building classification to
              ensure the protection of people and property. What may seem to be
              the smallest of modifications to a fire door can have a
              devastating effect on the whole building in the case of a fire.
            </p>

              quotation listing costs of any remedial repairs or replacements
              for fire safety installations which do not comply with the
              standards can be provided.
