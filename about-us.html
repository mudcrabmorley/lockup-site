            <p class="mb-4">
            Lock Up Industries was founded in 2000 by Stig Gronroos, who built the company on a strong foundation of quality workmanship, compliance expertise, and hands-on service. His belief in doing things right the first time set the standard for the company’s values and client relationships.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
            Over the years, Lock Up Industries expanded through trusted client relationships, word-of-mouth, and consistently reliable results — supporting a wide range of clients from high-security government institutions to large-scale commercial projects.
            </p>
            <p>
            Today, the company is led by Caleb Gronroos, who worked alongside Stig for many years. Caleb brings a high level of commitment to quality and extensive hands-on experience, with a clear focus on maintaining Lock Up Industries’ long-standing values.
