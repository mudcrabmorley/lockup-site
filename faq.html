  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800">What are Fire Doors?</h3>
  <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    Fire Doors are an integral component of the fire protection in buildings and are known as “passive fire protection systems”. They are installed in walls constructed as fire barriers and each fire door has a fire rating known as a fire resistant level (FRL) as does the wall itself. The term “fire door” is the common short form used for a “fire-resistant-doorset”. A fire resistant doorset consists of a door leaf, doorframe and associated hardware such as closers, handles, locks, vision panels, air grills and matching fire door tags on the door and door frame. Fire doors are required to be self-closing and latching. Fire doors allow a passageway through fire resistant walls for building occupants. When closed fire doors restrict the spread of smoke, flames, toxic gases and other effects of fire.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800">How do I know if my building has Fire Doors installed?</h3>
  <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    If you are unsure of whether your building has fire doors installed you should look at the building’s plans and specifications which were accepted as part of the building’s approval. The building owner should have a copy of these plans and the building’s Certificate of Classification. Alternatively, the local government should have a copy of the building’s approval records in their files. You can also contact a building certifier to confirm the requirements for the building and they will be able to identify your building’s classification and by using the date of approval and the applicable legislation and codes, the prescribed Fire Safety Installations can be ascertained.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800">What are my obligations as a Building Manager/Owner?</h3>
  <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    Queensland is governed under the Queensland Development Code (QDC) Mandatory Part 6.1 - Maintenance of fire safety installations.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    Prescribed fire safety installations are services and equipment that are required by the Act to safeguard occupants from illness or injury while evacuating during a fire and to provide facilities for occupants and Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) to undertake fire-fighting operations. These installations can also prevent the spread of fire between floors or compartments of a building.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    If you have a prescribed fire safety installation in your building you must comply with the code.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    Queensland Development Code (QDC) MP 6.1 requires the building occupier to provide a copy of the yearly 'occupier's statement' to the Commissioner of the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) confirming that the building's fire safety installations have been maintained in accordance with the QDC. The occupier's statement must be submitted when the annual maintenance program for all of the fire safety installations has been finished. For more information on your obligations please refer to Queensland Development Code MP 6.1 Guidelines or the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services website.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800">How often should I get my fire doors inspected?</h3>
  <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    The frequency of your building's required inspections is based on the classification of your building listed against the NCC (National Construction Code). In most cases your building Certificate of Classification will be on display near your front entry. Your building classification is then referenced against QDC MP6.1 for your required frequencies. For example: Class 2 Residential Unit Complex require inspections every 12 months, whereas Class 5 commercial and office based buildings require every 6 months.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800">Does someone need to be at my building for a fire door inspection?</h3>
  <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    It is not essential for a building manager to be present at time of a fire door inspection. However, our staff will need to have access to appropriate keys and swipe cards while conducting the inspection. A building manager may be required on site for some construction work involving fire door installations.
  </p>
  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800">Who can install a fire door?</h3>
  <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    With regards to passive Fire Safety Installations, an appropriately qualified person is someone who holds a specific licence to carry out work on that particular prescribed fire safety installation. This licence can only be issued by the Queensland Building and Construction Commission (QBCC). Lock Up Industries are fully licensed to Repair, Replace, Inspect, Test and Certify Fire Doors.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800">Do all fire doors require Tags?</h3>
  <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    Buildings approved after 1 April 1976 under the Building Act 1975 require compliance tags to be fitted to all fire doors. Fire door compliance tags are an important part of the fire door. They show the fire rating, manufacturer, applicant, certifier and year installed. Fire doors that have been replaced after 1 April 1976 all require tags to be fitted. If your door is missing the compliance tag and has only recently been installed or replaced, you may be able to contact the company that installed the door for re-certification. Unfortunately, if this is not possible, then you have no other option other than to replace the door.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800">What hardware components can be fitted on fire doors?</h3>
  <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    All the hardware components associated with a fire door are key elements that combine to achieve the overall FRL (Fire Resistance Level) that the fire door complies with and is certified to. These components must be tested and approved by a registered testing authority. Only hardware that has been approved and tested for that particular brand of fire door should be installed.
  </p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800">What about asbestos in fire doors?</h3>
  <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    Some buildings constructed before January 1990 may have fire doors using thermal insulation that is asbestos containing material (ACM). ACM is a health hazard, and the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 and Work Health and Safety Regulation 2011 detail the obligations of building owners for managing and removing ACM.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    If a fire door is damaged to expose friable asbestos material, the material and door will need to be removed by an asbestos removalist who has a certificate to perform the work issued by Workplace Health and Safety Queensland.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    For fire doors where the asbestos is bonded or enclosed, the door must be entered onto an asbestos register for the building, have a suitable label to ensure maintenance workers are aware asbestos is present, and be managed through an asbestos management plan controlling maintenance work and other activities that could lead to the ACM being disturbed.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    For further information about asbestos management, please contact Workplace Health and Safety Queensland on 1300 369 915.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    Lock Up Industries is fully licensed to safely remove non-friable / bonded asbestos.
